# Quiz Back Button Implementation

## Overview
Added a back button to the QuizFragment to allow users to navigate back to the home fragment easily.

## Changes Made

### 1. Layout Updates (`fragment_quiz.xml`)
- **Added header container**: LinearLayout containing back button and video title
- **Back button**: ImageButton with arrow back icon
- **Improved layout**: Better spacing and alignment for header elements

### 2. Code Updates (`QuizFragment.kt`)

#### New UI Components:
- Added `btnBack: ImageButton` property
- Added `ImageButton` import

#### New Methods:
- `goBackToHome()`: Main method to handle back navigation
- `showExitConfirmationDialog()`: Shows confirmation dialog if user has started quiz
- `navigateBackToHome()`: Actually performs the navigation

#### Enhanced Features:
- **Smart back navigation**: 
  - If user hasn't answered any questions → direct back
  - If user has answered questions → show confirmation dialog
- **Hardware back button support**: Override Android's back button behavior
- **Progress protection**: Warns user about losing progress

### 3. User Experience Improvements

#### Confirmation Dialog:
- **Title**: "Exit Quiz"
- **Message**: "Are you sure you want to exit? Your progress will be lost."
- **Buttons**: 
  - "Exit" → Navigate back
  - "Continue Quiz" → Stay in quiz

#### Visual Design:
- Back button with arrow icon
- Clean header layout with proper spacing
- Consistent with Material Design guidelines
