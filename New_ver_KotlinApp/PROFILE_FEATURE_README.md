### 2. Video Grid with Tabs
- **Videos Tab**: Shows user's uploaded videos
- **Liked Tab**: Shows videos the user has liked
- **Grid Layout**: 2-column responsive grid
- **Video Cards**: Thumbnail, category, likes count with heart icon

  - Video Creator (10+ videos)
  - Social Butterfly (100+ followers)
  - Point Collector (5000+ points)
- **Progress Tracking**: Level progress and next milestone indicators
- **Point Formatting**: Smart formatting (K, M for large numbers)

### 4. Data Models
- **Enhanced User Model**: Added profile fields (name, title, profile picture, social stats)
- **Enhanced Video Model**: Added thumbnail, likes count, views count
- **Gamification Manager**: Centralized gamification logic

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `ProfileViewModel.kt` - ViewModel for profile data management
- `ProfileVideoAdapter.kt` - Adapter for video grid
- `GamificationManager.kt` - Gamification logic and calculations
- `item_profile_video.xml` - Layout for individual video items
- `ic_heart.xml` - Heart icon for likes
- `ic_edit.xml` - Edit icon for profile editing

### Modified Files
- `profile.kt` - Complete rewrite with new functionality
- `fragment_profile.xml` - New layout matching the design
- `User.kt` - Added profile fields
- `Video.kt` - Added video metadata fields
- `colors.xml` - Added new color resources

## Usage

### Basic Profile Display
The profile automatically loads user data and displays:
- User information from SharedPreferences
- Sample data for demonstration (if no real data exists)
- Video grid with tabs for Videos/Liked content

### Gamification Features
- Points are automatically calculated and displayed
- Levels are determined based on point thresholds
- Badges are checked and awarded automatically
- Progress towards next level is tracked

### Video Management
- Videos tab shows user's uploaded videos
- Liked tab shows videos the user has liked
- Click on any video to play (currently shows toast message)

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModel manages data and business logic
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access through repositories
- **LiveData**: Reactive UI updates
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous operations

### Dependencies Used
- Material Design Components (TabLayout, CardView)
- RecyclerView with GridLayoutManager
- ViewModel and LiveData
- SharedPreferences for user data

### Gamification Logic
- Level calculation based on point thresholds
- Badge checking with multiple criteria
- Progress tracking for next milestones
- Smart number formatting for large values

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real Image Loading**: Integrate Glide/Picasso for profile pictures and video thumbnails
2. **Video Player Integration**: Connect to actual video player
3. **Edit Profile Screen**: Implement profile editing functionality
4. **Badge Display**: Add badge showcase in profile
5. **Achievement Notifications**: Enhanced badge earning notifications
6. **Social Features**: Implement following/follower functionality
7. **Analytics**: Track user engagement and progress

## Testing
The implementation includes sample data for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would:
1. Connect to real user data from Supabase
2. Implement proper image loading
3. Add error handling for network issues
4. Include unit tests for gamification logic
5. Add UI tests for profile interactions
